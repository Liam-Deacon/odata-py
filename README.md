### Python implementation of the odata standard ###

[Core Documentation](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-v3-documentation/odata-core/)

This is a work in process.
When a feature is described in the odata documentation but not yet implemented in code a `NotImplementedError` will be raised.
The code has only been tested against an oracle db, but sqlalchmy expression builder has been used extensivly in the hope that the code will be made portable.
